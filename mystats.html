            <h1>Biryani</h1>
            <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of South Asia. It is made
                 with spices, vegetables, rice, and usually some type of meat. In some cases without
                  any meat, and sometimes with eggs and potatoes.
                I like biryani because It is a hearty meal that one can enjoy at any hour of the day or night.</p>

                  <h1>Sports Table</h1>
                  <p>Now I am going to create sports table. it consists of Three column's. The first column should be the name of a sport.
                    The second column should be the reason why you recommend it. The third column
                    is how many hours in an average week that you would spend participating in the
                    sport.</p>
